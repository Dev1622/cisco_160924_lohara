System Flow Overview


1.Database Setup: The system creates the books table in the SQLite database if it doesn't already exist. If the database is empty, it scrapes  book data and inserts it into the database.

2.Book Management: Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books:
Add Book: Allows users to add new books with ID, title, price, and stock.
Update Book: Users can modify the title, price, or stock of a book.
Borrow Book: Users can borrow a book, which decreases the stock by 1 if stock is available

3.Email Functionality: Manager can send the mail to users 

4.Stock Management: The total stock of all books is calculated, and the stock for individual books can be displayed.

5.Exit and Export: When the user exits the system, all books are exported to a JSON file for backup or future use.
